<p>WordPress 5.0 Beta 5 is now available!</p>



<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>



<p>There are two ways to test this WordPress 5.0 Beta: try the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”), or you can&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta5.zip">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>



<p><strong>Reminder: the WordPress 5.0 release date has changed</strong>. It is now scheduled for release on&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/">November 27</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big issues that we’ve fixed since Beta 4:</p>



<h2>Block Editor</h2>



<p>The block editor has been updated to match the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-november-2/">Gutenberg 4.4 release</a>, the major changes  include:</p>



<ul><li>&nbsp;A <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11874">permalink panel has been added to the document sidebar</a> to make it easier to find.</li><li>Editor document panels can now be <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11802">programmatically removed</a>.</li><li>The uploading indicator for images and galleries has been replaced with a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11876">spinner and faded out image</a>.</li><li>The text and code editing blocks will now <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11750">use the full width of the editor</a>.</li><li>Image handling has been improved. Images now  take up the right amount of space for <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11846">themes with wider editors</a> (like Twenty Nineteen).<br></li><li>Hover styles are now <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10333">correctly disabled for mobile devices</a>.</li><li>The i18n module has been refactored to benefit from <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11493">significant performance gains</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, there have been some pesky bugs fixed:</p>



<ul><li>Better handling for <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11590">links without an href</a> attribute, which were showing as <code>undefined</code>.</li><li>Japanese text (double byte characters) are <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11908">now usable in the list block</a>.</li><li>Better handling for different text encodings (e.g. emoji) within a block <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/11771">in block validation</a>.</li></ul>



<p>A full list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-november-2/">Gutenberg 4.4 release post</a>.<br></p>

<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>
