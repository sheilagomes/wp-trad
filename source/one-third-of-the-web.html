<p>WordPress now powers over 1/3rd of the top 10 million sites on the web according to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all">W3Techs</a>. Our market share has been growing steadily over the last few years, going from 29.9% just one year ago to 33.4% now. We are, of course, quite proud of these numbers! <br></p>



<p>The path here has been very exciting. In 2005, we were celebrating <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2005/03/fifty-thousand/">50,000 downloads</a>. Six years later, in January 2011, WordPress was powering 13.1% of websites. And now, early in 2019, we are powering 33.4% of sites. Our latest release has already been <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/counter/">downloaded close to 14 million times</a>, and it was only released on the 21st of February.<br></p>

<p>Over the years WordPress has become the CMS of choice for more and more people and companies. As various businesses use WordPress, the variety of WordPress sites grows. Large enterprise businesses all the way down to small local businesses: all of them use WordPress to power their site. We love seeing that and we strive to continuously make WordPress better for all of you.</p>



<p>We&#8217;d like to thank everyone who works on WordPress, which is built and maintained by a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org">huge community of volunteers</a> that has grown alongside the CMS. This incredible community makes it possible for WordPress to keep growing while still also remaining <em>free</em>. And of course, we’d like to thank all of you <em>using</em> WordPress for using it and trusting in it. To all of you: let’s celebrate!</p>
