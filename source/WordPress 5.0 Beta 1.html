	<p>WordPress 5.0 Beta 1 is now available!</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don‚Äôt recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version, and if you are using an existing test site be sure to update the Gutenberg plugin to v4.1. </p>

<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.0 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you‚Äôll want ‚Äúbleeding edge nightlies‚Äù), or you can&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>

<p>WordPress 5.0 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/">November 19</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>The Block Editor</h2>

<p>The new Gutenberg block editor is now the default post editor!</p>

<p>The block editor provides a modern, media-rich editing experience. You can create flexible, beautiful content without writing a single line of code, or you can dive into the <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/">modern programming APIs</a> that the block editor provides.</p>

<p>Even before you install WordPress 5.0, you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">try the block editor here</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we recognise you might not be ready for this change quite yet. If that&#8217;s the case, you can install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/">Classic Editor plugin</a> now, which will keep the editor you&#8217;re familiar with as the default, even after you upgrade to WordPress 5.0.</p>

<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>

<p>Along with the new block editor, we have a new default theme, called Twenty Nineteen, which takes advantage of the new features the block editor provides.</p>

<p>You can read more about Twenty Nineteen in its <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/16/introducing-twenty-nineteen/">introduction post</a>, and follow along with development over on the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Default Themes</h2>

<p>Of course, we couldn&#8217;t release a beautiful new default theme, and leave all of our old ones behind. All the way back to Twenty Ten, we&#8217;ve updated every default them to look good in the new block editor.</p>

<h2>How to Help</h2>

<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> <strong>A known issue</strong>: the block autocompleter fails for blocks whose names contain  characters in non-Latin scripts. Adding blocks via the plus sign works, and this bug is fixed in the Gutenberg 4.1 plugin. üôÇ</p>
