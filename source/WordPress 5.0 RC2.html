<h2>Significant changes</h2>



<ul><li>We stopped rendering&nbsp;<em>AdminNotices</em>&nbsp;compatibility component, as this previous attempt at backward compatibility was bringing in numerous incompatible banners and notices from plugins.</li><li>An update to the parser to better deal with malformed HTML that could cause a loop. We&#8217;re only aware of this in the wild being triggered once in the <a href="https://gutenstats.blog/">over a million posts</a> made with Gutenberg, but it caused a loop so we wanted to fix for RC2.</li></ul>
