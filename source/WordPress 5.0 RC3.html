<p>The third release candidate for WordPress 5.0 is now available!</p>



<p><strong>WordPress 5.0 will be released on </strong><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/04/new-5-0-target-date/"><strong>December 6, 2018</strong></a>. This is a big release and needs&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;helpâ€”if you havenâ€™t tried 5.0 yet, now is the time!</p>



<p>To test WordPress 5.0, you can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin or you can&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-RC3.zip">download the release candidate here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>



<p>For details about what to expect in WordPress 5.0, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/11/wordpress-5-0-release-candidate/">first release candidate post</a>.</p>



<p>This release candidate includes a fix for some scripts not loading on subdirectory installs (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45469">#45469</a>), and user locale settings not being loaded in the block editor (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45465">#45465</a>). Twenty Nineteen has also had a couple of minor tweaks.</p>



<h2>Plugin and Theme Developers</h2>



<p>Please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 5.0 and update the&nbsp;<em>Tested up to</em>&nbsp;version in the readme to 5.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post to the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/">support forums</a>&nbsp;so we can figure those out before the final release. An in-depth field guide to developer-focused changes is coming soon on the&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">core development blog</a>. In the meantime, you can review the&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5.0+dev-notes/">developer notes for 5.0</a>.</p>
