<p>WordPress 5.0 Beta 4 is now available!</p>



<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>



<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.0 Beta: try the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”), or you can&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-beta4.zip">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>



<p><strong>The WordPress 5.0 release date has changed</strong>, it is now scheduled for release on&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-0/">November 27</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big issues that we’ve fixed since Beta 3:</p>



<h2>Block Editor</h2>



<p>The block editor has been updated to match the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/12/whats-new-in-gutenberg-12th-november/">Gutenberg 4.3 release</a>, the major changes  include:</p>



<ul><li>An <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/7718">Annotations API</a>, allowing plugins to add  contextual data as you write.</li><li>More consistent keyboard navigation between blocks, as well as back-and-forth between different areas of the interface.</li><li>Improved accessibility, with additional  labelling and speech announcements.</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, there have been some bugs fixed that popped up in beta 3:</p>



<ul><li>Better support for plugins that have more advanced meta box usage.</li><li>Script concatenation is now supported.</li><li>Ajax calls could occasionally cause PHP errors.</li></ul>



<h2>Internationalisation</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve added an API for translating your plugin and theme strings in JavaScript files! The block editor is now using this, and you can start using it, too. Check out the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/09/new-javascript-i18n-support-in-wordpress/">developer note</a>&nbsp;to get started.</p>



<h2>Twenty Nineteen</h2>



<p>Twenty Nineteen is being polished over on its <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen">GitHub repository</a>. This update includes <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43892">a host of tweaks and bug fixes</a>, including:</p>



<ul><li>Menus now  properly support keyboard and touch interactions.</li><li>A footer menu has been added for secondary page links.</li><li>Improved backwards compatibility with older versions of WordPress.</li></ul>



<h2>Default Themes</h2>



<p>All of the older default themes—from Twenty Ten through to Twenty Seventeen—have polished  styling in the block editor.</p>
