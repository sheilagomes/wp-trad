<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.0 is now available!</p>



<p>This is an important milestone, as we near the release of WordPress 5.0.&nbsp;<strong>The WordPress 5.0 release date has shifted from the 27th to give more time for the RC to be fully tested</strong>. A final release date will be announced soon, based on feedback on the RC. This is a big release and needs <em>your</em> help—if you haven’t tried 5.0 yet, now is the time!&nbsp;</p>



<p>To test WordPress 5.0, you can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin or you can&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.0-RC1.zip">download the release candidate here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>

<p>WordPress 5.0 introduces the <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">new block-based post editor</a>. This is the first step toward an exciting new future with a streamlined editing experience across your site. You’ll have more flexibility with how content is displayed, whether you are building your first site, revamping your blog, or write code for a living.</p>



<p>The block editor is&nbsp;<a href="https://gutenstats.blog/">used on over a million sites</a>, we think it&#8217;s ready to be used on all WordPress sites. We do understand that some sites might need some extra time, though. If that&#8217;s you, please install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/">Classic Editor plugin</a>, you&#8217;ll continue to use the classic post editor when you upgrade to WordPress 5.0.</p>



<p>Twenty Nineteen is WordPress&#8217; new default theme, it&nbsp;features custom styles for the blocks available by default in 5.0.&nbsp;Twenty Nineteen is designed to work for a wide variety of use cases. Whether you’re running a photo blog, launching a new business, or supporting a non-profit, Twenty Nineteen is flexible enough to fit your needs.</p>



<p>The block editor is a big change, but that&#8217;s not all. We&#8217;ve made some smaller changes as well,&nbsp; including:</p>



<ul><li>All of the previous default themes, from Twenty Ten through to Twenty Seventeen, have been updated to support the block editor.</li><li>You can improve the accessibility of the content you write, now that <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30421">simple ARIA labels</a>&nbsp;can be saved in posts and pages.</li><li>WordPress 5.0 officially supports the upcoming PHP 7.3 release: if you&#8217;re using an older version, we encourage you to <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/upgrade-php/">upgrade PHP</a>&nbsp;on your site.</li><li>Developers can now add translatable strings directly to your JavaScript code, using the new <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/09/new-javascript-i18n-support-in-wordpress/">JavaScript language packs</a>.</li></ul>
